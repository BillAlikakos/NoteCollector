# NoteCollector

Note Collector is a simple music-based game based on the libGdx cross-platform game development framework.  

The initial version of the application was developed by Vasileios Marantos and I developed various enhancements as part of my thesis.  
Enhancements include:  
-Responsive scaling
-Higher resolution assets (tested up to 1920*1080)
-Local multiplayer (up to 2 players) over a WLAN network
-Midi track serach/download 
-Custom background images
-Firebase integration for high score tracking
